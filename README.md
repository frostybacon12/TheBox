# TheBox
CS 1511 projects for fall semester, 2018.

To view the code for a project, follow this general path:
# P1 -> P1 -> P1.cpp

For project 7, you will need the header files and their respective .cpp files in addition to the P7.cpp file.

If you have any questions at all about any of the projects or coding challenges from lab, hit me up on snap.
