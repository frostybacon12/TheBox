# TheBox
CS 1511 projects for fall semester, 2018.

To view the code for a project, follow this general path:
# P1 -> P1 -> P1.cpp

For project 7, you will need the header files (bag.h and item.h) and their respective definition files (bag.cpp and item.cpp) in addition to the main class file, P7.cpp.

If you have any questions at all about any of the projects, hit me up on snap:
